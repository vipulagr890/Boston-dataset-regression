# Boston DataSet Linear Regression based House price prediction

In the following, Repository I have created an end to end project for prediction of house price using 
Linear regression techniques.

Problem statement:
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.


## Update 1:
Completed analysis of the data.
### Observation:
1. Due to the high correlation of Indus and age column, We have to remove the following columns. To remove multi correlation between the following columns.

2. To fit the linear model, We chose all those feature column for input which have high correlation with the target 'Price' column.

## Update 2: 
Completed IPYNB Notebook for the the regression problem using linear regression.

## update 3:
created the Flask and JSON file for the server and frontend file

### update 4:
Completed the frontend for the Boston Dataset.

The preview of the frontend:
